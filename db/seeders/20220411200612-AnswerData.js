                    I used to call my orders in without issue until I received Hunan Beef instead of Szechuan Beef.
                    When I called to let them know a mistake was made (thinking they might've accidentally switched bags when packing), I was met with an incredibly argumentative tone and her insistence I ordered Hunan Beef NOT Szechuan Beef.  Mind you, I am giving feedback not complaining. When I assured her that due to a food allergy, I wouldn't have ordered Hunan Beef without special instructions, she persisted.  Finally I told her that I didn't call to argue with her but alert her to a small mistake.  Needless to say, you better believe I place ALLLLLL my orders online so I have written documentation in the event there's an issue with an order.`,
